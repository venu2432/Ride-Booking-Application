# Ride-Booking-Application
This repository hosts a Spring Boot application designed for a ride booking service. It allows users to book rides and drivers to accept them. The application integrates PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension for handling geospatial data and uses the Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) for distance calculations.
